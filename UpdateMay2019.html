# Preliminary experiments on the hyperelastic composite materials with holes and inclusions

## Geometry with 3 inclusions
I reran this numerical experiment with a Poissons ratio of 0.499 as before. I noticed I had an error in my plot for this example only and corrected it. The force displacement curve is shown below. As you can see I actually underestimate (significantly) the peak force here. The behavior is different because symmetry was regained in the response which is not observed experimentally.
